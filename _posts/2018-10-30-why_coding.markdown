Hello! 

The other day in my homeroom, I locked one of my students in my large storage closet without using a key.  How? I convinced him the door was locked by holding the knob when he tried it initially...and then I walked away.  He spent the rest of homeroom sitting in an unlocked closet while the rest of us died of silent laughter.  One of the goals of homeroom is to "build student community" and this prank definitely achieved that  (disclaimer: this student has a great sense of humor and loved being the recipient of the locked closet prank.  He now will try to hide in my closet to see if I notice).  

This event left me with a great memory of just kicking it with my students, but has also given me a reflection point about the power of the locked-unlocked closet.  A lot of us have sat in an "unlocked closet."  What is an unlocked closet?  A common example is the student who doesn't apply themselves in my biology class because they don't think they are a "science" person.  For whatever reason, students will frequently arrive in my classroom with a preconceived notion of their ability to achieve.  I use that example because that was me in high school.  It wasn't until college that my first biology professor helped me open the unlocked door of my "closet" and achieve success in science.  I eventually evolved from being "not a science person" to being a science educator. 

One of the goals of k-12 education is to prepare students to be college and career ready after high school. Because of this,  I try to stay educated on post high school career and education trends.   Last year, I started casually reading about different pathways into tech careers.  I wondered, "Should I encourage my students to consider this career path when we are talking about ideas for college degrees?"  At this time, a huge paradox existed in my understanding of software engineering.  On one hand there is an "anyone can learn how to code" message that exists in k-12 education.  On the other hand, software engineering existed in MY mind as being something close to magic.  I was essentially sitting in an unlocked closet.  

It didn't feel right to tell my students that they could learn any of my high school biology material if they used the right learning method, but have this whole field of tech seem like impossible magic.  I decided I needed to hold myself accountable to my own beliefs and learn more about coding.  Around December of 2017, I learned about Free Code Camp and decided to give it a try.  Suddenly, coding was something that I would do in my free time.  My teaching job, while rewarding, was extremely stressful last year and coding became a huge stress reliever.      There is just something really satisfying about creating code that works.   I recently finished the initial code for my final Ruby project and it is so satisfying to ask my CLI Data Gem MedSearch for information and then receive that information because of code that I wrote.  I don't know what my future with software engineering looks like yet, but my goal with Flatiron is to keep learning more.
