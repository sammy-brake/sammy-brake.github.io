I finished my final project and I thought that it might be useful to compile a list of all the outside resources that I found helpful. Here they are!

1. [Article about Presentational vs Container Components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0) This article helped me know the differnence between Presentational Components, which are mainly concerned with how things look, and Container Components, which are stateful and concerned with how your app works. The article also has other good information about React terminology and is full of examples and comparisons.
 
2. [Reducers](https://redux.js.org/basics/reducers) I used this article to clarify my understanding about how Reducers work. It was a good supplement to my Learn.co curriculum

3. [Embed Google map](https://medium.com/@aliglenesk/how-to-embed-a-google-map-in-your-react-app-23866d759e92) In the future, I'd like to embed a map in my React app that will display the locations of all of my interns. I haven't used this resource yet, but I've read it over and I think this is going to be the starting point for my next addtion to my app!

4. [React State Management with Redux](https://medium.com/the-web-tub/managing-your-react-state-with-redux-affab72de4b1) This is a good article on how Redux can be used to manage state in a React app. It explains the 4 methods supplied by the Redux library and how actions and reducers are used to manage the Redux store. 

I did a lot of Googling while making this app for reminders of syntax and CSS styling, but these were the links that I found so useful that I bookmarked them to revisit in the future.
