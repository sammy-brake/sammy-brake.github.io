For my final project, I made an internship management dashboard. I am currently managing or "coaching" a group of interns and we use a big Google sheets spreadsheet to hold and update all the information. I decided to use my final project to start creating a little intern management system that looks a little nicer than the big spreadsheet. 

My project started off easily enough! It was not complicated to set up my Rails API backend or set up my create-react-app.  It was also easy to determine the structure I wanted and to hard code an initial app with the routes that I wanted using React and React Router. 

I did start to struggle with my show page displaying one intern from my array of intern objects for my show page. When the page initially renders, it would not have access yet to my props and so would throw an error.  I eventually used a ternary operator to only display my show page code when the page had access to those props. 


Overall, I have learned so much during the time that I spent building my final project. After my project review, my goal is to work on embedding a Google map component because my interns are situated all over the city in different offices.
